In the last years many accurate decision support systems have been
constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic
to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an
ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this
crucial weakness sometimes at the cost of scarifying accuracy for
interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be
used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a
solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, delineating explicitly
or implicitly its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim
of this paper is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in
the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black
box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired
explanation this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more
useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open
black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open
questions in perspective.
