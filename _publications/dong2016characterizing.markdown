Characterizing driving styles of human drivers using vehicle sensor data,
e.g., GPS, is an interesting research problem and an important real-world
requirement from automotive industries. A good representation of driving
features can be highly valuable for autonomous driving, auto insurance, and
many other application scenarios. However, traditional methods mainly rely on
handcrafted features, which limit machine learning algorithms to achieve a
better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning solution to
this problem, which could be the first attempt of extending deep learning to
driving behavior analysis based on GPS data. The proposed approach can
effectively extract high level and interpretable features describing complex
driving patterns. It also requires significantly less human experience and
work. The power of the learned driving style representations are validated
through the driver identification problem using a large real dataset.
