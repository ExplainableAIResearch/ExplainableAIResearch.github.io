The rising popularity of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
understand high-performing black boxes, also raised the question of how to
evaluate explanations of machine learning (ML) models. While interpretability
and explainability are often presented as a subjectively validated binary
property, we consider it a multi-faceted concept. We identify 12 conceptual
properties, such as Compactness and Correctness, that should be evaluated for
comprehensively assessing the quality of an explanation. Our so-called Co-12
properties serve as categorization scheme for systematically reviewing the
evaluation practice of more than 300 papers published in the last 7 years at
major AI and ML conferences that introduce an XAI method. We find that 1 in 3
papers evaluate exclusively with anecdotal evidence, and 1 in 5 papers evaluate
with users. We also contribute to the call for objective, quantifiable
evaluation methods by presenting an extensive overview of quantitative XAI
evaluation methods. This systematic collection of evaluation methods provides
researchers and practitioners with concrete tools to thoroughly validate,
benchmark and compare new and existing XAI methods. This also opens up
opportunities to include quantitative metrics as optimization criteria during
model training in order to optimize for accuracy and interpretability
simultaneously.
