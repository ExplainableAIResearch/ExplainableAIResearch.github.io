In recent times, the use of separable convolutions in deep convolutional
neural network architectures has been explored. Several researchers, most
notably (Chollet, 2016) and (Ghosh, 2017) have used separable convolutions in
their deep architectures and have demonstrated state of the art or close to
state of the art performance. However, the underlying mechanism of action of
separable convolutions are still not fully understood. Although their
mathematical definition is well understood as a depthwise convolution followed
by a pointwise convolution, deeper interpretations such as the extreme
Inception hypothesis (Chollet, 2016) have failed to provide a thorough
explanation of their efficacy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
interpretation that we believe is a better model for explaining the efficacy of
separable convolutions.
