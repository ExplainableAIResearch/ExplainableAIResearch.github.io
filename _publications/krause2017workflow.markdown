Human-in-the-loop data analysis applications necessitate greater transparency
in machine learning models for experts to understand and trust their decisions.
To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and
domain experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary
classifier. The approach leverages "instance-level explanations", measures of
local feature relevance that explain single instances, and uses them to build a
set of visual representations that guide the users in their investigation. The
workflow is based on three main visual representations and steps: one based on
aggregate statistics to see how data distributes across correct / incorrect
decisions; one based on explanations to understand which features are used to
make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights on
potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a
long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare
professionals who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they
developed. The case study from this collaboration demonstrates that the
proposed workflow helps experts derive useful knowledge about the model and the
phenomena it describes, thus experts can generate useful hypotheses on how a
model can be improved.
