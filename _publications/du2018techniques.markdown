Interpretable machine learning tackles the important problem that humans
cannot understand the behaviors of complex machine learning models and how
these models arrive at a particular decision. Although many approaches have
been proposed, a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and challenges
is still lacking. We provide a survey covering existing techniques to increase
the interpretability of machine learning models. We also discuss crucial issues
that the community should consider in future work such as designing
user-friendly explanations and developing comprehensive evaluation metrics to
further push forward the area of interpretable machine learning.
