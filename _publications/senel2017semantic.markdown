Dense word embeddings, which encode semantic meanings of words to low
dimensional vector spaces have become very popular in natural language
processing (NLP) research due to their state-of-the-art performances in many
NLP tasks. Word embeddings are substantially successful in capturing semantic
relations among words, so a meaningful semantic structure must be present in
the respective vector spaces. However, in many cases, this semantic structure
is broadly and heterogeneously distributed across the embedding dimensions,
which makes interpretation a big challenge. In this study, we propose a
statistical method to uncover the latent semantic structure in the dense word
embeddings. To perform our analysis we introduce a new dataset (SEMCAT) that
contains more than 6500 words semantically grouped under 110 categories. We
further propose a method to quantify the interpretability of the word
embeddings; the proposed method is a practical alternative to the classical
word intrusion test that requires human intervention.
