Saliency detection aims to detect the most attractive objects in images and
is widely used as a foundation for various applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel salient object detection algorithm for RGB-D images using
center-dark channel priors. First, we generate an initial saliency map based on
a color saliency map and a depth saliency map of a given RGB-D image. Then, we
generate a center-dark channel map based on center saliency and dark channel
priors. Finally, we fuse the initial saliency map with the center dark channel
map to generate the final saliency map. Extensive evaluations over four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably
against most of the state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, we further discuss
the application of the proposed algorithm in small target detection and
demonstrate the universal value of center-dark channel priors in the field of
object detection.
